# What are the existential risks of AI
This website has been created in an attempt for me to try and answer the question ‚ÄùWhat are the dangers and existential risks that AI can have on humans‚Äù. Through this I will be looking at multiple examples and the ways that it can have an dangerous effect on the way that people in the modern times live their lives being through the way that they go through social media and the way the they consume the media that they are looking at or just in the way that they intact with it as a whole and how it can have the negative effect and impact their lives. While also looking through the different ways that you are able to see that ai might try and enter our lives a lot more and have an overall bigger impact on our lives than a lot of people might be able to realise as we look and find out that it Is something that isn‚Äôt as researched and looked into compared to he positive effects hat it does have on our lives as the negatives are something that seems to be less researched and looked into as the positives that it brings us.

# What studies say about the dnagers of AI
Hilton B, talks about the risks that ai brings to us and mention about the ways that these types of things are looked at and talk abut about the way that they are studied, He mentions that when doing the research about the way that people do go around looking at the way that AI research goes that they its estimated that only around 400 peopled worldwide are actively searching the risks that it can bring to us which would bring the percentage of people that are actually studying it down to 1% compared to the rest which are all seem to be looking at the whole picture, however when looking at the people that are studying it we are shown that some experts do believe that the chance of AI actually having any existential poems down to around 0.1% while others believe that it I possible that the Riss of something like this happening is actually a lot higher and is around 50% this is something that we can see once again changes drastically as a lot of people look at the risks of this and think that there is a possibility that it could end up causing human extinction compared to others thinking that there his actually no risk involved at all with it and the fact that we are able to see that there is such a low amount of people that are studying it just shows us that the dangers of AI are things that we may not be able to understand yet as we have not eve really began to look at the dangers that it brings to us.

# AI in the mediacl industry and the risks:
Nucci wrote an argument on the way that AI has started to be used inside of the medical industry and that there is a program that is being used to try and help people making decisions and other such things for patients that it helps them with certain decisions, however there are problems that have been found when using scenting like this in the industry, one of the problems with it is that it doesn‚Äôt really take into account the medications that the person might be already taking and looks at the bigger areas of data instead of trying to take everything into account which can then lead to people getting the wrong treatments as it doesn‚Äôt take everything into account, and the other problem that has been found with this is that it i something that can be used when it comes to looking at decision making as a whole within the medical industry which can possibly then cause us to rely on it. Looking through these situations it is clear that it I something hat can be abused within the industry and that it is possible that it can cause problems and when looking at the risks that it can cause humans we are looking at it in an industry that we require to live as medications and other things like medications that people use are part of it and if something went wrong with it there is a possibility that it could cause us more harm than anything else.

Looking at another area of the medical industry and using AI we can see that Fisherman() has discussed and talked about the ways that AI are being used and the way that it is effecting the radiology aspect of the medical industry. Looking through AI as a whole we have found that it i possible of creating very realistic images but its also capable of doing the same hone it comes to looking at sounds and when these things were put in front of people they were unable to tell the difference and say which one is real and which one is fake due to simply how real they looked compared to the real things and due to the fact that things like these already exist it Is possible that they can actually infiltrate the medical industry by hackers and then it is possible that even more problems can occur due to these aspects of AI. Also hacks are something that are likely possible and have already happened and when it did happen the doctors had no idea of it actually occurring and didn‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell which and if any of the photos had been adjusted by AI to the point that the attack was 99.2% successful. This all just shows us again about the risks that AI actually has and the fact that it is something that is inside of the medical industry and that we are able to use to help us but at the same time it is something that can cause us even more problems just again shows us that it is something that we can‚Äôt fully trust due to the fact that it is something that we don‚Äôt fully understand and it is something that is going to be used in a very crucial industry for us.

# Dangers of AI on society:
Bozic talks about the dangers of AI and mentions a few of them that we should look at because they effect the way the way that it can be used. One of them being bias due to the fact that ai is still something that does need programming fro it to work something that we are able to do is influence the way that a lot of them might work fro example when using it to try and figure out which politician should we vote for it is possible that the person creating it can put their own bias into into which can then effect the results so there is also a slight human aspect that we need to be aware of, another reason that we should be careful of it is because it can help to cause even more unemployment fro example we have seen that in a lot of industries that there is machines that are slowing taking the jobs of people and with AI becoming something that is more a more used it is likely that for certain job roles they will be replacing the need for people and then what this might end up causing is the fact that the economy might take a big hit due to the fact that a lot less people will have jobs meaning that they will have less money that they can spend which in turn causes a hit for the economy due to the use of AI, One more use that we can see fro AI and being the most obvious one is the malicious intent that it can cause as we‚Äôve already looked through the way that AI can cause problems within the medical industry you can also see that due to the easy access and usability that someone might be able to use it to gain access to government information and other such things like peoples private information and for reasons such as these it is because we should have more regulation to something like this that is so easily accessible fro everyone and due to everyone having access can show us that certain individuals may be Abel to inflict harm upon others.

Gorman talks about and shows us some more dangers that AI has and the way that they are able to do. One of the things that is mentioned is the way that AI is able to learn about the preferences that humans have fro example someone may be really into certain topics and then the AI is able to learn and adapt to those things which I turn can help the person to learn more about something or just get more information for the topics that interest them however it i every possible to also see that this is bad due to the way that the AI is going to be able to learn the person‚Äôs behaviours and then learn more about them which as said before but can be a good thing but due to the fact that it just kerns all o this information by it self and doesn‚Äôt have anyone controlling it make sit seem dangerous as there is no one that is doing anything for it, and something that i shown to us by this happening it shows us that an AI is able to get more powerful in a way because it is then able to learn a lot more about a person and the able to learn more about groups due to the way that adapts and learns about others.

# Conclusion 
In conclusion I think that it is safe for us to see that there are dangers of AI everywhere and not only that but it can effect fields like the medical one by the way that it is used and by how easily easily accessible it is to everyone but not only that it is also the fact that due t the fact that anyone is able to gain access to it then it i possible that people with bad intentions then are able to care harm to others, another aspect is the fact that it is able to just roam in a way and learn about people and then adapt to way that people work and live their lives with no one behind it trying to control it is something that causes harm and could end up causing more problems fr humans in the future, but finally the fact that it seems like the risks are something that aren‚Äôt as looked into as the benefits that it can gives us makes the risks of ai more dangers but at the same time more unknown as we don‚Äôt know what it is capable of.
