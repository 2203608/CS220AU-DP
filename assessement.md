## Self-assessment
Using the marking rubric, I've assessed my own progress: I think that the website I created shows well that I have a good understanding of the information that I have collected and think that I have shown that I have answered my question well and shown that I am capable of it and have done it well. I think the way that I have designed my website is really well due to the way that I have laid out my whole design for the website has been really good but it also look really clean as it is simple to find all of the information about everything but I also think that the way ti have laid I out with the photos and the text makes it all look really professional. I think that the amount of time the I have put into the website looks really good for the way that it has been completed. The main thing that I think I could have used more improvement on was interacting with my peers due to the fact that I didn’t interact as much with everyone as I had hoped which I think might of been able to help me a bit more with the overall design or different methods of collecting research. Overall I think that the project went really well for me I think that the final product that I ahem made is of high quality and that I have shown an overall good understanding of the whole project.

Feedback given by: 2317769 17/1/24. 2203608 impressively initiated the discussion with a clear reference to the question, skillfully concluding sentences with ties to the thesis statement. Noteworthy was the provision of multiple examples, coupled with articulate explanations anchored in the context of the question. The inclusion of real-life examples, along with the acknowledgment of associated problems and proposed solutions, added depth to the content. The presentation encompassed a diverse range of knowledge, incorporating vivid imagery, pertinent statistics, and a thorough evaluation of pros and cons. Importantly, 2203608 seamlessly linked the conclusion back to the initial thesis statement, maintaining a cohesive structure. Proper referencing at the end further reinforced the reliability of the information presented. While the work demonstrated a strong understanding and knowledge base, a potential enhancement could involve delving deeper into the issues raised by the AI and incorporating additional information. Additionally, the inclusion of more imagery and hyperlinks might enhance accessibility and engagement for the reader. Overall, 2203608 provided a well-constructed, easily comprehensible response, making it challenging to identify significant shortcomings due to its straightforward nature.
