# Linking Digital Identities to Existential Risks
<!-- the title is the research question -->

Note: This article is not yet finished. I am [sharing the writing process](https://github.com/khofstadter/CS220AU-DP/commits/main/index.md) step-by-step as a teaching method. My primary goal with this is not just to complete an article, but to demonstrate the evolution of thoughts, edits, and improvements along the way.

## Introduction
Before I started teaching the Autumn part of the Navigating the Digital World module in 2021 (the CS220AU) at the University of Essex, it primarily looked at the field of digital identities, the digital world (e.g., password management, CV enhancements, the use of certain software and hardware for content production<!-- what else?-->).

<!-- explain that AU is more practical and SP more theoretical? -->

There was nothing wrong with this of course. However, to make this module more in line with my own expertise and interests, more engaging for students, and more timely with our collective issues, from 2021 onwards, my students have been developing their professional identities via setting up their own websites for resident modes of engagement with the web for their assignments (instead of simply submitting an essay in a Word or PDF file). This decision was based on my previous success at the Anglia Ruskin University using this method.[^Hofstadter2019SelfAndPeerAssessmentToolAndRationale] 

My first cohorts in 2021 could develop their websites with any website builder (e.g., [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)) and populate them with whatever content they thought could help showcase their professional identities (e.g., CVs, portfolios, artistic work, blog posts).

In 2022, I refined the assignment and asked students to only develop websites with GitHub Pages and to produce content on these websites that links digital identities and existential risks. This content could either reflect on all links they found or one more specifically.

As students' feedback was positive, I asked students in 2023 to look at the connections between digital identities and existential risks again, but this year to find one specific connection to reflect on using their websites.

<!-- I also have an interest in both fields, but I would say I am more of an expert in the field of digital identities than existential risks. -->

## Linking the Fields

## Conclusion
### Recommendations
These are my recommendations for teachers/students: 

### Next Steps
My next steps to further develop this module are 

- to consider asking CS220AU students to submit a short video summarizing their portfolios, similarly to my Sonic Art students in 2019:
