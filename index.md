# What are the existential risks and dangers of AI


## What studies show us about the dangers of AI:
This website has been created in an attempt for me to try and answer the question ”What are the dangers and existential risks that AI can have on humans”. Through this I will be looking at multiple examples and the ways that it can have an dangerous effect on the way that people in the modern times live their lives being through the way that they go through social media and the way the they consume the media that they are looking at or just in the way that they intact with it as a whole and how it can have the negative effect and impact their lives. While also looking through the different ways that you are able to see that ai might try and enter our lives a lot more and have an overall bigger impact on our lives than a lot of people might be able to realise as we look and find out that it Is something that isn’t as researched and looked into compared to he positive effects hat it does have on our lives as the negatives are something that seems to be less researched and looked into as the positives that it brings us.

## AI in the medical industry and the risks
Nucci wrote an argument on the way that AI has started to be used inside of the medical industry and that there is a program that is being used to try and help people making decisions and other such things for patients that it helps them with certain decisions, however there are problems that have been found when using scenting like this in the industry, one of the problems with it is that it doesn’t really take into account the medications that the person might be already taking and looks at the bigger areas of data instead of trying to take everything into account which can then lead to people getting the wrong treatments as it doesn’t take everything into account, and the other problem that has been found with this is that it i something that can be used when it comes to looking at decision making as a whole within the medical industry which can possibly then cause us to rely on it. Looking through these situations it is clear that it I something hat can be abused within the industry and that it is possible that it can cause problems and when looking at the risks that it can cause humans we are looking at it in an industry that we require to live as medications and other things like medications that people use are part of it and if something went wrong with it there is a possibility that it could cause us more harm than anything else.

Looking at another area of the medical industry and using AI we can see that Fisherman() has discussed and talked about the ways that AI are being used and the way that it is effecting the radiology aspect of the medical industry. Looking through AI as a whole we have found that it i possible of creating very realistic images but its also capable of doing the same hone it comes to looking at sounds and when these things were put in front of people they were unable to tell the difference and say which one is real and which one is fake due to simply how real they looked compared to the real things and due to the fact that things like these already exist it Is possible that they can actually infiltrate the medical industry by hackers and then it is possible that even more problems can occur due to these aspects of AI. Also hacks are something that are likely possible and have already happened and when it did happen the doctors had no idea of it actually occurring and didn’t and wouldn’t be able to tell which and if any of the photos had been adjusted by AI to the point that the attack was 99.2% successful. This all just shows us again about the risks that AI actually has and the fact that it is something that is inside of the medical industry and that we are able to use to help us but at the same time it is something that can cause us even more problems just again shows us that it is something that we can’t fully trust due to the fact that it is something that we don’t fully understand and it is something that is going to be used in a very crucial industry for us.
