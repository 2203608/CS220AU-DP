# How to Link Digital Identities to Existential Risks?
<!-- the title is the research question -->

Note: Article in Progress 

This article is not yet finished. I am sharing the writing process step-by-step as a teaching method. My primary goal with this is not just to complete an article, but to demonstrate the evolution of thoughts, edits, and improvements along the way. As a student following this progress, take this as an opportunity to observe and learn from the workflow of creating a written piece, evolving from its initial draft to final publication.

## Introduction
Before I started teaching the Autumn part of the Navigating the Digital World module in 2021 (the CS220AU), it primarily looked at the field of digital identities, the digital world (e.g., password management, the use of certain software and hardware for content production<!-- what else?-->).

<!-- explain that AU is more practical and SP more theoretical? -->

To make this module more in line with my own expertise and interests, more engaging for students, and more timely with our collective issues, from 2021 onwards, my students have been developing their professional identities via setting up their own websites for resident modes of engagement with the web for their assignments (instead of simply submitting an essay on a Word or PDF file), and since 2022[^Hofstadter2019SelfAndPeerAssessmentToolAndRationale], they have used this website to address an assignment brief that links digital identities to existential risks.

My first cohorts in 2021 could develop their websites with any website builder (e.g., [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)) and populate them with whatever content they thought could help showcase their professional identities (e.g., CVs, portfolios, artistic work, blog posts).

In 2022, I refined the assignment and asked students to only develop websites with GitHub Pages and to produce content on these websites that links digital identities and existential risks. This content could either reflect all the connections they found or one more specifically.

Students' feedback was positive, so I ask students in 2023 to look at the connections between digital identities and existential risks again, but this year to find one specific connection to reflect on.

<!-- I also have an interest in both fields, but I would say I am more of an expert in the field of digital identities than existential risks. -->

## Linking the Fields

## Conclusion
### Recommendations
These are my recommendations for teachers/students: 

### Next Steps
My next steps to further develop this module are 

- to consider asking CS220AU students to submit a short video summarizing their portfolios, similarly to my Sonic Art students in 2019:
