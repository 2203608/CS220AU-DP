# What are the existential risks and dangers of AI


## What studies show us about the dangers of AI:
This website has been created in an attempt for me to try and answer the question ”What are the dangers and existential risks that AI can have on humans”. Through this I will be looking at multiple examples and the ways that it can have an dangerous effect on the way that people in the modern times live their lives being through the way that they go through social media and the way the they consume the media that they are looking at or just in the way that they intact with it as a whole and how it can have the negative effect and impact their lives. While also looking through the different ways that you are able to see that ai might try and enter our lives a lot more and have an overall bigger impact on our lives than a lot of people might be able to realise as we look and find out that it Is something that isn’t as researched and looked into compared to he positive effects hat it does have on our lives as the negatives are something that seems to be less researched and looked into as the positives that it brings us.
